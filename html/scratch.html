    <h2>From a young age</h2>
    <br><br>
    Even when I was young, I loved to go fishing. It was something that I did with my dad. 
    Something that I absolutely loved was going to the Gulf Coast to fish. I would catch Redfish, 
    speckled trout, sheephead, stingray, and so many more.

    <h2>Bass Fishing in Mississippi</h2>
    <br><br>
    When I moved to Mississippi, It was in the middle of the Covid pandemic and I didn't have a lot to do.
    My Uncle was good friends with a guy who had some ponds where we would go fishing. These ponds became
    our honey hole where we would catch big fish. I loved fishing there and had great memories

    <h2>I don't like to fish alone</h2>
    <br>
    Fishing was something that I loved to do with my family and friends. 
    I can't really remember a time that I would just go by myself.
    This last summer, my childhood best friend came to Mississippi and wanted to go fishing. Naturally, we took
    him to the honey hole. I coached him and he was able to catch some big fish and go home with some stories.
    My dad and my younger brother came that day too and we had a great time.
